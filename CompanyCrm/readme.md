<h1 align="center">Simple CRM</h1>

## Description

This repo is a simplified CRM that allows users to create a login and manage customers and their addresses. User management is handled through ASP.NET Core Identity. Users can sign in through Google or through two factor authentication, and once logged in, they can add/update/delete new customers along with mutiple addresses per customer. Data is sent from the MVC web application to a separate API that communicates with SQL Server through EF Core.

The project is not yet finished, so expect to see improvements regularly (including to this readme).
